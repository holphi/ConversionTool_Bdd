Feature: IEQ & GEQ data converstion
	As a profession tuner for Windows platform
	I want to be able to convert GEQ & IEQ data from the tuning xml to DAX2 DB
	So the GEQ and IEQ data can be applied by the DAX2 Windows product
	
Background:
	Given I have opened the DTT conversion tool with argument --import-profile-tuning

@mytag
Scenario: Convert GEQ and IEQ data
	When I set the DB file to DAX2.sdf
	And I set the XML file to Tuning_File_IEQ_GEQ.xml
	And I click on the convert button
	Then I should see a message box with the title Great News and the message Successfully Converted the XML to Database shows up
	When I press OK button on the message box
	And I close the DTT conversion tool
	Then I should be able to query below 28 new records in the table GEQ_Bands of the DAX2 DB
